1. What are you making ? A basic calculator that does basic math.
2. Run the file and a prompt appears in the command line.
3. mention that only one type of operation is possible at once, use set function and remove additional mathematical operators 
if the length is more than 1.
4. once that's true, extract values and operators. Once there is only one operator it's easy to calculate the values.
5. process the values and loop through it with the calculation.
